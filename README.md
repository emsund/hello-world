# hello-world

I'm new to GitHub, and following the intro tutorial. This respository, hello-world, was created by following that tutorial. After I finish the tutorial, I plan to use it as a sandbox to learn about features in GitHub.

A bit about myself:
I enjoy programming in Python. One of my current small projects includes a D'ni clock, with a tk/tcl GUI.
